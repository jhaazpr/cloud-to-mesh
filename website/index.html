        </section>
        <section class="text">
          3D scanners allow us to incorporate objects in the real world into the realm of computer graphics.
          3D scanners work by sampling the surface of an object and outputting a <em>point cloud</em> of sampled
          vertex positions. However, in order to manipulate scanned geometries, we require <em>meshes</em>, which
          are structures composed of faces, vertices, and edges. To facilitate the point cloud-to-mesh pipeline,
          we present Meshedit++, an interactive editor which allows users to: visualize point clouds, convert
          point clouds to potentially complex meshes, and simplify reconstruced meshes for easier use. By integrating
          all steps of the pipeline into one editor, we intend to transform the pipeline from an automatic, hidden
          process into an interactive and illuminating experience.

          Technical Approach
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          For this project, we implemented three separate stages of the point cloud to mesh pipeline in one editor.
          The three stages are: visualizing point clouds, reconstructing meshes from point clouds, and simplifying
          reconstructed meshes. The last step is necessary because if the sampling rate from a 3D scanner is high,
          the resulting mesh will contain a large number of extraneous vertices which will make the mesh overly
          complicated and difficult to work with.
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          In the following sections, we describe the algorithms and technical details for each stage of the
          pipeline.
