        </section>
        <section class="text">
          3D scanners allow us to incorporate objects in the real world into the realm of computer graphics.
          3D scanners work by sampling the surface of an object and outputting a <em>point cloud</em> of sampled
          vertex positions. However, in order to manipulate scanned geometries, we require <em>meshes</em>, which
          are structures composed of faces, vertices, and edges. To facilitate the point cloud-to-mesh pipeline,
          we present Meshedit++, an interactive editor which allows users to: visualize point clouds, convert
          point clouds to potentially complex meshes, and simplify reconstruced meshes for easier use. By integrating
          all steps of the pipeline into one editor, we intend to transform the pipeline from an automatic, hidden
          process into an interactive and illuminating experience.

          Technical Approach
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          For this project, we implemented three separate stages of the point cloud to mesh pipeline in one editor.
          The three stages are: visualizing point clouds, reconstructing meshes from point clouds, and simplifying
          reconstructed meshes. The last step is necessary because if the sampling rate from a 3D scanner is high,
          the resulting mesh will contain a large number of extraneous vertices which will make the mesh overly
          complicated and difficult to work with.
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          In the following sections, we describe the algorithms and technical details for each stage of the
          pipeline.

          Meshedit (without the ++) was previously used for viewing meshes for the second homework in
          <a href="http://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/cs184_sp16">UC Berkeley's CS184: Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging.</a>
          We extended Meshedit's functionality to load <strong>.ply</strong> file, which consist principally of a list
          of vertex points:
        </section>
        <section class="subimage"><img src="./images/ply_screenshot.png"></section>
        <section class="text">
          To load points, we first parse the vertices from the .ply file and place each in a <strong>Vector3D</strong>
          object, which is simply an object with x, y, and z fields that supports vector operations such
          as vector addition, dot products and norms. Next, we create a <strong>PointCloud</strong> object which contains
          the vertices, encapsulate the object in a <strong>PointCloudNode</strong> which we push to the back of a list
          of nodes in the global <strong>Scene</strong> object. This setup is neccessary for working with current rendering
          pipeline.
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          Next, we implemented the <strong>renderPoints</strong> function which, like <strong>renderMesh</strong>, is called
          many times per second and draws OpenGL objects to the canvas. Note that the point-drawing OpenGL code could be more cleanly
          implemented with <strong>glDrawArrays</strong>, but using a for loop worked in practice, even for very large point clouds.

          We used .ply files from the <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">Stanford 3D scanning repository</a>.
          Note that while these .ply files contain information about the faces of the triangle, we limit ourselves to parsing
          only the vertex information.
          Here are two point cloud visualizations of the scanned side of a dragon statue, one with the viewer
          zoomed out and one zoomed in such that the points become clearly visible.

          One advantage of point cloud visualization is that it allows for visualizing objects that would
          have a very high poly count as a mesh, and thus would be slow to load and render. Here is a point cloud

          <p> <strong> Data Structures:</strong> In order to implement the Ball Pivoting algorithm, we first had to set up a couple data structures, namely BPAEdge, BPALoop, and BPAFront. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          <p>BPAFront encapsulates the growing mesh and keeps track of all point and polygons at all times. The name Front, refers to the set of active edges (contained in Loops) that we are currently considering in order to expand the mesh. There is a single Front per mesh.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          <p>BPALoop is simply a linked list wrapper of edge that stores a pointer to the first edge in the list. The front contains a list of Loops that are currently being expanded. Loops may merge into each other or break apart as a result of join/glue operations.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          <p>BPAEdge was necessary because the ball pivot algorithm pivots over an edge. Half edges addeded unnecessary complexity, while the polygon soup and vertices lacked the relationship between points i and j that we needed. We only keep track of edges on the constantly expandiing loop front, so every edge must have a corresponding triangle. We keep track of the third point and call it o; we will need it for our calculations later on.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong>

          The Ball Pivot algorithm consists of 2 main parts, the Ball Pivot step in which we discover new points and add to the mesh we are currently building on, and Seed Triangle selection, which occurs when ball pivoting gets stuck and requires us to select a new set of edges to expand on. This continues until we've considered all points that the ball can reach. </p>

          <p><strong>1. Ball Pivot</strong>
          First we select an active edge from the front. An active edge is any edge that has not been fully explored yet and thus has the opportunity for expansion. We then find all points in a 2*rho radius from the midpoint m between i and j. These are our candidate points. For each candidate point x, we calculate the center of the sphere of radius rho that touches i, j and x: c_ijx. r is the distance from m to the center of the current center of the ball, c_ijo. For each calculated center c_ijx we check if it is on the circle gamma, defined by the radius r and center m, perpendicular to the pivot edge ij. We then choose the c_ijx that we encounter first while pivoting on the edge. </p>

          <section class="text">
          <p>Then we have found k = x, we need to incorporate the triangle ijk into our mesh and update our loop and other pointers. We expand the loop to incorporate edges ik and kj, and we remove edge ij. This operation is described as a join operation on an edge and point in the pseudocode above.</p>

          <section class="text">
          <p>As our loop expands to fit whatever complex geometry the point cloud describes, we may find ourselves having to break apart loops creating more loops, or merging loops into a single loop. These operations are called glue operations. The glue operations ensure that at the end of the while loop, all our loops merge and we are left with a single mesh. We chose not too include glue operations as they were very complicated to implement, and while we were left with multiple meshes, they still described all the points in the point cloud reachable with our rho-sphere.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Find Seed Triangle</strong>
          Seed triangle selection is very similar to finding the next position of the sphere in the ball pivot step. We find all pairs of points in a radius 2*rho of a random, unused point. Then we verify that sphere of radius rho can lie on these three points. Finally, we check that the sphere does not contain any other data points and that it lies on the "outside" of the point cloud. However, since we didn't have vertex normals to work with, we were unable to tell where the ball was.</p>

          <p><strong>Collapse Edges:</strong>
            Most of the popular algorithms for simplifying meshes include iterative edge contraction. Therefore, to use these algorithms we have to impelement the abiblity to collapse edges. To do so we have to remove the selected edge from the mesh, along with the faces, halfedges and vertex that will no longer be needed. While doing this we have to make sure that all of the remaining mesh features are correctly re-attached to eachother. Here is a diagram of an edge collaps:
            <section class="subimage"><img src="./images/collaps.png"></section>
            Im our implementation we first check to make sure the selected edge is not a boundary edge. We then check to make sure that there are no more than two connected neighboring vertices of v1, and v2. If there are more then two connections, collapsing the edges will cause the mesh to become non-manifold. Next, to avaoid malloc and segmenation fault errors, we have to set the halfedge values of the edges, that are going to be remaining from the dark grey diamond that collapses(see figure above), to the halfedges on the outer side of the diamond, we have to set the halfedge valuse of the edges that are being removed to the halfedges on the inner side of the diamond, and we must set the halfedge values of the remaining connected neighboring vertices to the halfedges on the outer side of the diamond. Instead of creating a new vertex v we keep the vertex v1 and attached all of the halfedges that used to attach to v2 to v1. After they are all attached to v1, we close the gap by setting the twin values of the remaining half edges. Finally we delete all of the un-needed fatures and return v1.

      <section class="text">
            Since vertices can have different numbers of connected edges we used this code to iterate through features around a vertex:

                //TEST IF CONNECTED HERE
                h = h_twin->next();               // move to the next outgoing halfedge of the vertex.
                //SET HALFEDGE VERTEX HERE

          <p><strong>Quadric Error:</strong>
            Now that we can collapse edges the question is which edges to collapse. We want to collapse the edge that will change the mesh the least. To find this edge we must develop some measure of change. Quadric error is one measure of cost and the algorithm for using this measure to simplify meashes was developed by Michael Garland and Paul Heckbert. This is the algorithm that we use in Meshedit++. The main idea for quadric error is calculating the distance from any point to a plane, and summing these distances for each vertex. For a plane point x, normal N, and point p, the equation for calculating the distance from p to the plane is given by:

            Using these vertex quadrics we then iterate through all the edges in the graph and add them to an EdgeRecord. EdfeRecord uses the quadrics of the two vertices of the edges, the sum of which is the quadric for the edge, to calculate the optimal position for the resulting vertex of an edge collapse.

          <li>When dealing with Halfedge structures make sure to account for all of your pieces or you can run into infinite loops and seg faults.</li>
          <li>There are cases where an edge colapse can cause a mesh to be non-manifold and some of these cases are hard to implement checks for.</li>
